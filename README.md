# react-guest-list-online

With this React application, it is easy to create a list of people, e.g. guests invited to an event. It is possible to enter first and last name and add the guest to the guest list.

Furthermore, it is possible to mark single guests as attending, as well as deleting single guests from the list.

The guest data is stored on a server deployed on Heroku.
